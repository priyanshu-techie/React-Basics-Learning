# Change the branches to see all my begginer Projects.


## NOTES

* index.html has the root div where all the elmes will be inserted
* main.jsx is where the app is setup using React , React DOM , React.strictMode, etc.
* main.jsx has the app component 
* Inside App.jsx, arrange all the components 
* Use the component folder to have all the components
* Make a style folder to have all the css files.

 `NOTE : Many of errors you are getting (Ex- using "class" instead of "className" not giving the {key} is arr.map to uniquely identify elems ) is not  by default.  But by external tools like (ESlint).`
